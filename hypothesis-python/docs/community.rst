The Hypothesis community is small for the moment but is full of excellent people
who can answer your questions and help you out. Please do join us.

The two major places for community discussion are:

* `The mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hypothesis-users>`_.
* An IRC channel, #hypothesis on freenode, which is more active than the mailing list.

Feel free to use these to ask for help, provide feedback, or discuss anything remotely
Hypothesis related at all.

Please note that `the Hypothesis code of conduct <https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis-python/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst>`_
applies in all Hypothesis community spaces.
